# 3DGameJava
Creating a 3D FPS Game in Java from scratch without using the full potential of the GPU, but using only the Java built-in libraries.
In this program, we are only using the Java's built-in libraries. Not going to make some high-end graphics and we are not going to use
the full potential of our GPU with OpenGL or anything like that. Only using built-in libraries and functions/methods and doing everything from scratch.
This is designed to show how to make a game without potentially using the graphics card, only learning the Java language.
Using the tutorial '3D Game Programming in Java' series by the YouTube channel 'The Cherno' (https://www.youtube.com/c/TheChernoProject/about)
Most of the techniques are commented with line comments, but reading the Java Documentation about the built-in classes and functions are highly recommended!
